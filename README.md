# Advent of Code 2018

Welcome to my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) 2018 contribution! The solutions are written in C++20 using Visual Studio. I used the 2018 event to learn and practive C++ code, so it may have some quirks here and there. If you want to have some inspirations for solving the puzzles it may be worth a look anyway. Happy reading!

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of code is made by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).

> [It is] an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

For more information see [about Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018/about).

## Running the solutions
For running the code you need [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/) with the [Desktop development with C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-170) workload installed. Open the .sln file in Visual Studio. The solution is organized into one folder per day and a project per puzzle (i. e. part 1 and 2 are separate solutions per day). Navigate to the project you want to run and hit F5.
